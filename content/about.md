# Hello there!
This is my personal blog where I write about whatever interests me at the time, this is mostly low level computer stuff,
by that I mean the stuff that happens inside the "black boxes" that are so common in programming, I also write about other programming topics and life topics,
ocasionally, hope you enjoy your stay!
